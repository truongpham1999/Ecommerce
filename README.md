# Ecommerce
E-commerce website using Django

## Distinctiveness & Complexity:
- This project is different from other CS50W projects. This project is more complex than Project 2 and Project 4, because this application handles the Cart session, where users can add products into the cart, and those products will be added to the user's cart if they log in to their account.
- Users also can update the quantity of each product in the cart and also can delete them from the cart.
- Users can buy products by using their account or buying products without logging in.
- A verification link will be sent to the user's email as soon as creating an account completely
- Users can manage their account profile and view their orders to track what they bought. In addition, they can also edit their address.

- All of the pages in this application handle responsive displays for both mobile and desktop devices.
